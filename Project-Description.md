## Project Background Description: 

A heater/cooler unit (HCU) is a medical device that outputs either hot or cold water to a water blanket, a water based body wrap, or a blood heat exchanger to help control the temperature of a patient. We plan to build a small, cost effective, easy to use, and portable HCU that holds 2 liters of water. We plan to be sponsored by Gentherm Medical (formally known as Cincinnati Sub Zero), so all parts should be provided. This project will require the design of a housing for the device to hold all of the internal components, an electrical system that connects all the mechanical components (pump, flow sensor, etc.) to the control system, testing of the internal components to make sure optimal temperatures are met, and the programming of software to control the device using a microcontroller.

## Project Problem Statement: 

There are no inexpensive, simple, and portable adaptations of HCUs available in the medical field today.
  * Current solutions are bulky, expensive, and overly complicated for many use-cases.
  
## Applicable Skills and Interests:
* Zack Sullivan:
  * Microcontroller programming
  * C++ experience
  * Electrical component and wiring experience

* Justin Boamah:
  * HCU work experience
  * Electrical board, wiring, and component design experience

## Team Approach:

We will aprroach this problem by first getting the smaller and less expensive components to be used all connected and tested to ensure that they will provide adequate cooling and heating in this configuration. Then, we will develop the casing and overall product packaging necesarry to achieve our goals for the product. Our overall goal is to provide a portable, easy to use, and inexpensive HCU that can provide all of the basic functions that are common for the majority of HCU use-cases. We expect to have a working demo product at the end of our project.
